            Learning about the vast prevalence of HIV/AIDS worldwide opened Dhrumi’s eyes to the kind of effect the infectious diseases have on all kinds of people. Though the world may be out of her reach, she believes small positive changes in society can go a long way, and that’s why she couldn’t pass up an opportunity to get involved and help raise awareness for HIV/AIDS, taking part in the unstoppable ripple effect. Feel free to contact her if you have any questions about Ripple Effect.

            Claire Stoffers is the Director of Finance and a Biomedical Engineering major at Georgia Tech. She joined Ripple Effect because HIV/ AIDS is an issue that can easily be over-looked even though it affects so much of the world, and education and awareness is one of the best ways to prevent its spread.

            As a biology major and pre-med student Mikaela has always had an interest in the way various diseases impact the community. Upon transferring to Tech at the start of her third year she was looking for an organization and cause to dedicate her time to. With the high prevalence of HIV/AIDS in Atlanta, she felt this was a matter that needed attention. She believed, that by joining Ripple Effect, she could contribute her time to raise awareness and educate others on the issue. Mikaela hopes that this year she cannot only raise awareness about HIV/AIDs on Georgia Tech’s campus but also throughout her community.
